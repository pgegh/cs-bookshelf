# CS631 Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment
A course that I found randomly on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0qfF8MrJ-jxMfirAdxDs9zIiBg2Wug0z). The course has a [webpage](https://stevens.netmeister.org/631/).

## My comments
- a brief history of the UNIX system
- basics of the UNIX system
  - the architecture:
 
    ![UNIX Architecture](https://notes.shichao.io/apue/figure_1.1.png "The UNIX Architecture")
  - commands, system calls, and library functions
  - man pages: 1=commands 2=system calls, 3=library function. Following standard definitions ensures compatibility on different UNIX environments.
  - the standard is IEEE POSIX, see [SUS](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/).
- C as programming language choice in this course.
  - features:
    - function prototypes: separate interface from implementation.
    - generic pointers (void *): big amount of flexibility but also risk.
    - abstract data types: helps portability by leaving the definition of a datatype to the OS.
  - Treat warning as errors to protect yourself against bugs. Add the the flaggs `-Wall -Eerror -Wextra` to `cc`
- "Consistancy underlies all principles of quality"
- CS required reading [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)
- Unix programs should have the following properties:
  - Small and simple
  - Accept input via `stdin`
  - Sends output on `stdout`
  - Generates meaningful errors on `stderr`
  - Returns meaningful numerical value, see `errno(3)`, `strerror(3)`, and `perror(3)`
  - have a manual page
- You can pipe multiple UNIX programs making a [UNIX pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)).
