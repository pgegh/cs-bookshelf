# CS631 Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment
A course that I found randomly on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0qfF8MrJ-jxMfirAdxDs9zIiBg2Wug0z). The course has a [webpage](https://stevens.netmeister.org/631/).

## My comments
- a brief history of the UNIX system
- basics of the UNIX system
  - the architecture
  - commands, system calls, and library functions
  - man pages: 1=commands 2=system calls, 3=library function. Following standard definitions ensures compatibility on different UNIX environments.
  - the standard is IEEE POSIX, see [SUS](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/).
- C as programming language choice in this course.
  - features:
    - function prototypes: separate interface from implementation.
    - generic pointers (void *): big amount of flexibility but also risk.
    - abstract data types: helps portability by leaving the definition of a datatype to the OS.
  - Well writen C follows common Unix best practices by returning meaningful numerical value, see `errno(3)`, `strerror(3)`, and `perror(3)`.
  - Treat warning as errors to protect yourself against bugs. Add the the flaggs `-Wall -Eerror -Wextra` to `cc`
